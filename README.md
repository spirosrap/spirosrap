Systematic Trader · AI Systems Builder

I build transparent, versioned trading systems with circuit breakers, regime logic, and execution guardrails—designed for measurable edge and psychological integrity.

## What I’m building now

- Versioned BTC execution systems (frozen rules, checkpoints, scaling ladders, circuit breakers)
- MAE/MFE integrity tracking, expectancy monitoring, and regime-aware diagnostics
- Automation pipeline: Linux scripts → tmux workflows → watchdogs → safe execution
- Stability under pressure: defined freeze windows + post-trade review protocols

## Signature engineering

### Automated Trading Stack (BTC)

A disciplined execution engine built around:

- RSI signal with confirmation
- Regime detection (volatility + trend context)
- Pre-entry rejection filters for weak / uncertain regimes
- Live MAE/MFE watchdog + circuit breakers
- Scaling ladder with monitored checkpoints
- No mid-cycle optimization (changes only at checkpoints)

Core intent: keep the system measurable, explainable, and safe to run under real pressure.

## Toolbox

`Python` `pandas` `NumPy` `PyTorch` `scikit-learn` `Jupyter`  
`Linux` `Docker` `tmux` `VS Code` `Cursor`  
`TradingView` `Pine Script` `CCXT` `Coinbase Perps`

## Operating principles

- Risk first: sizing, SL/TP asymmetry, circuit breakers
- Frozen rules: modify only at checkpoints with enough data
- Track edge: expectancy, MAE/MFE, volatility context, regime shifts
- Build simple systems you fully understand before scaling complexity
- Losses are data, not identity

---

## Current focus

- LLM-assisted journaling, diagnostics, and signal triage
- Automated post-trade evaluation with regime tagging and edge tracking
- Meta-system design: versioning, freeze windows, scaling ladders
- Reinforcing stability as margin increases
