## What I’m building now

- Versioned BTC execution systems with frozen rules and checkpointed upgrades
- MAE/MFE integrity tracking, expectancy monitoring, and regime-aware diagnostics
- Linux automation stack: scripts → tmux workflows → watchdogs → safe execution
- Stability under pressure: freeze windows and post-trade review protocols

## Signature engineering

### Automated Trading Stack (BTC)

A disciplined execution engine built for transparency and control:

- Signal with confirmation + regime detection (volatility/trend context)
- Pre-entry rejection filters for weak or uncertain regimes
- Live MAE/MFE watchdogs and circuit breakers
- Scaling ladder with monitored checkpoints
- No mid-cycle optimization (changes only at checkpoints)

Design intent: measurable, explainable, and safe to run under real pressure.

## Toolbox

`Python` `pandas` `NumPy` `PyTorch` `scikit-learn` `Jupyter`  
`Linux` `Docker` `tmux` `VS Code` `Cursor`  
`TradingView` `Pine Script` `CCXT` `Coinbase Perps`

## Operating principles

- Risk first: sizing, SL/TP asymmetry, circuit breakers
- Frozen rules: change only at checkpoints with enough data
- Track edge: expectancy, MAE/MFE, volatility context
- Keep systems simple; losses are data

---

## Current focus

- LLM-assisted journaling, diagnostics, and signal triage
- Automated post-trade evaluation with regime tagging and edge tracking
- Meta-system design: versioning, freeze windows, scaling ladders, stability as margin scales
